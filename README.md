# Robot-Navigation
Robot navigation prediction with Deep Learning

In this project, you will classify robot sensor data using a long short-term memory network.

Overview

This data set consists of two numeric sequences and one categorical vector. At every time step, there are two sensor measurements and a class label indicating which direction the robot should move. There are four classes:
move forward
slight left turn
slight right turn
sharp right turn

Data Set and Scripts

The project files includes two versions of the data and two template scripts. You don't need to use the template scripts, but they provide details on the data set and a suggested architecture.
